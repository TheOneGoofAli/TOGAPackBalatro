# TOGAPackBalatro
A personal timewaster project that is a mod for Balatro.
Uses Steamodded 1.0.0-ALPHA old-calc (https://github.com/Steamodded/smods/tree/old-calc) and a few Lovely-based patches.
Has not been tested with Better Calc changes, may or may not work there as-is!

Talisman 2.0.0 or higher is a required dependency. https://github.com/MathIsFun0/Talisman

_Please use the source code download options for grabbing the mod._ That way, I don't have to remake the 7z archive every single time.
