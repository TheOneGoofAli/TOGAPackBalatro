# TOGA's Stuff
A personal timewaster project that is a mod for Balatro.

Uses Steamodded 1.0.0-ALPHA with the BetterCalc 2.2 changes and a few Lovely-based patches.
https://github.com/Steamodded/smods

Talisman 2.1.0 (development builds work too) is a required dependency.
https://github.com/MathIsFun0/Talisman

_Please use the source code download options for grabbing the mod._ That way, I don't have to remake the 7z archive every single time.
