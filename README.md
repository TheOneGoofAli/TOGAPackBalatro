# TOGAPackBalatro
A personal timewaster project that is a mod for Balatro.
Uses Steamodded 1.0.0-ALPHA releases and a few Lovely-based patches.

Talisman 2.0.0 or higher is a required dependency. https://github.com/MathIsFun0/Talisman

_Please use the source code download options for grabbing the mod._ That way, I don't have to remake the 7z archive every single time.
